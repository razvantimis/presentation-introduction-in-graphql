# The Battle: REST vs GraphQL
Over the past years, REST has become the standard for designing web APIs. However, REST APIs have shown to be too inflexible to keep up with the rapidly changing requirements of the applications that access them.

GraphQL was developed to cope with the need for more flexibility and efficiency! It solves many of the shortcomings and inefficiencies that developers experience when interacting with REST APIs.

In this presentation, Iâ€™ll show you the most important difference between GraphQL and REST APIs plus a short live coding demo, to see how we can implement the GraphQL specification in Javascript, powered by Deno JS.

Feel free to join my session! It doesn't matter if you are a guru or still a novice in REST and GraphQL, Everyone is welcome!
